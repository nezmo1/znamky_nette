TwiGrid
=======

... is an experimental DataGrid for Nette Framework.

**Demo**: http://twigrid.1991.cz

**Demo sources**: https://github.com/uestla/twigrid-demo

It's based on another (and great) datagrid written by @hrach - https://github.com/nextras/datagrid. My datagrid is hugely inspired by this component and its programming ideas and therefore I would like to give this man a maximum credit and respect :-)

However - I did some things differently or have used a different approach.

I liked the idea of UI antipatternity of paginating, built my datagrid using Twitter Bootstrap styling and "componentized" the datagrid template so that you can extend it and customize it the way you like.
